            <h1>Imola Glory: Javad Dominates Round 4 of the Season for Ferrari</h1>
            <p>Imola, Italy - Round 4 of the 2025 Formula One season delivered pure drama and celebration for the
                Tifosi as Ferrari's own Javad stormed to a commanding victory at the legendary Autodromo Enzo e Dino
                Ferrari. Under the clear skies of Emilia-Romagna, the red car was unstoppable, leading every lap from
                pole to the checkered flag in front of an ecstatic home crowd.
                <br><br>
                After securing pole position in Saturday's qualifying session with a blistering lap ahead of Max
                Verstappen's Red Bull and Oscar Piastri's McLaren, Javad looked in total control heading into Sunday.
                And when the five lights went out, the Ferrari driver made no mistake — launching cleanly off the line
                and immediately defending his lead into Tamburello. From there, it was a masterclass in consistency and
                composure.
                <br><br>
                Behind him, Verstappen kept the pressure on in the opening stint but could do little against Javad's
                flawless pace. The Red Bull crossed the line 5.410 seconds adrift, acknowledging afterward that “the
                Ferrari was just too quick today.” Meanwhile, Charles Leclerc delivered a strong recovery drive to claim
                the final podium spot, finishing over half a minute behind his teammate but ensuring a double points
                haul for the Scuderia on home soil.
                <br><br>
                Further down the order, Mercedes showed flashes of promise with Lewis Hamilton and George Russell
                finishing fourth and sixth respectively, split by Piastri's McLaren in fifth. Yuki Tsunoda impressed yet
                again with a solid seventh, followed closely by Gabriel Bortoleto, who earned valuable points in eighth.
                <br><br>
                The only major incident came early in the race, when Lando Norris and Nico Hülkenberg tangled on lap 2
                in the Villeneuve chicane, forcing both to retire and bringing out a brief safety car. The collision
                ended what could have been a strong weekend for both drivers, particularly Norris, who had qualified in
                the top ten.
                <br><br>
                But the day belonged entirely to Javad. Calm, precise, and unshakable under pressure, he delivered
                Ferrari's first win of the season in front of their adoring fans. As the Italian flags waved and the
                crowd erupted in chants of “Forza Ferrari,” the victory felt symbolic — a statement of intent for both
                driver and team.
                <br><br>
                With this win, Javad moves closer to the top of the championship standings, and Ferrari heads to the
                next round with renewed confidence. If this performance at Imola is any indication, the Prancing Horse
                may well be back in the hunt for glory.
                <br><br>
                Final Classification:
                <br><br>
                1. Javad (Ferrari)<br>
                2. Verstappen (Red Bull) +5.410<br>
                3. Leclerc (Ferrari) +37.676<br>
                4. Hamilton (Mercedes) +45.414<br>
                5. Piastri (McLaren) +49.556<br>
                6. Russell (Mercedes) +59.793<br>
                7. Tsunoda (Red Bull) +59.846<br>
                8. Bortoleto (Sauber) +1:00.199<br>
                9. Norris (McLaren) DNF<br>
                10. Hülkenberg (Sauber) DNF
                <br><br>
                A perfect weekend in Italy — Javad leads Ferrari back to the top.
